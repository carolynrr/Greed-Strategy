# Greed-Strategy

The Assignment

For this assignment, you will create a computer controlled greed strategy. You will extend the GreedStrategy class with a class that plays greed. You will need to create the choose method, programming it so that it makes the choice in response to the number of dice, available options, and bank, that results in the highest average points per turn.

You can use the strategy evaluator provided to test your strategy over a large number of turns. When you make a change you can decide if it is an improvement or a decrease. This lets you try various ideas. You can also use the practiceGreed method to try out ideas before you program them.

There is a sample strategy included in the Greed-Code folder called RandomStrategy that chooses at random among the options.

Give your class a name which is your last name followed by your first name, followed by GreedStrategy. If you are working in a group, include all your last names instead.
